  abstract = {Recently, a number of multi-domain network resource information and reservation systems have been developed and deployed, driven by the demand and substantial benefits of providing predictable network resources. A major lacking of such systems, however, is that they are based on coarse-grained or localized information, resulting in substantial inefficiencies. In this paper, we present Explorer, a simple, novel, highly efficient multi-domain network resource discovery system to provide fine-grained, global network resource information, to support high-performance, collaborative data sciences. The core component of Explorer is the use of linear inequalities, referred to as resource state abstraction (ReSA), as a compact, unifying representation of multi-domain network available bandwidth, which simplifies applications without exposing network details. We develop a ReSA obfuscating protocol and a proactive full-mesh ReSA discovery mechanism to ensure the privacy-preserving and scalability of Explorer. We fully implement Explorer and demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy through extensive experiments using real network topologies and traces.},
