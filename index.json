In this paper, we introduce ONV, a novel abstraction of flow-based on-demand network view. The ONV models network views as linear constraints on network-related variables in application-layer objective functions, and provides “equivalent” network views that allow applications to achieve the same optimal objectives as if they have the global information. We prove the lower bound for the number of links contained in an equivalent network view, and propose two algorithms to effectively calculate on-demand equivalent network views. We evaluate the efficacy and the efficiency of our algorithms extensively with real-world topologies. Evaluations demonstrate that the ONV can simplify the network up to 80% while maintaining an equivalent view of the network. Even for a large network with more than 25 000 links and a request containing 3000 flows, the result can be effectively computed in less than 1 min on a commodity server.","tags":["data structures","network servers","software defined networking","telecommunication network topology","network-aware adaptive applications","storage resources","business values","network-related variables","application-layer objective functions","optimal objectives","on-demand network abstraction","objective-driven network abstraction","ONV models network","real-world topologies","commodity server","on-demand equivalent network","Measurement","Network topology","Topology","Routing","Quality of service","Bandwidth","IEEE transactions","Software-defined networking","routing algebra","quality of service","resource abstraction"],"title":"An Objective-Driven On-Demand Network Abstraction for Adaptive Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geng Li","Y.

Current solutions for updating SDN configurations focus on one single update at a time, leading to slow, sequential (i.e., blocking) update execution. In this paper, we develop update algebra, a novel, systematic, theoretical framework based on abstract algebra, to enable continuous, non-blocking, fast composition of multiple updates. Specifically, by modeling each data-plane operation in the set of data-plane operations to be executed by an update as a set-theoretical projection, update algebra defines novel operation composition so that the number of projections for the same match remains constant regardless of the number of updates to be composed, leading to substantial performance benefits. Specifying the dependencies of the data-plane operations in updates as a subset of a free monoid in the general case and as partial ordering for basic consistency, update algebra defines update composition that preserves consistency, even under partially-executed updates, to guarantee correctness. We conduct asymptotic analysis, extensive benchmarking using a real controller, and integration with a real application to demonstrate the benefits of update algebra. In particular, our asymptotic analysis demonstrates that in independent-update dominant settings, update completion time of update algebra remains asymptotically constant despite growth of the number of updates to be executed. Our benchmarking shows that update algebra can achieve 16x reduction in update latency even in settings with an update arrival rate of only 1. 6/s. Our integration with Hedera, a real SDN traffic engineering application, shows that update algebra can reduce average link bandwidth utilization by 30% compared with sequential updates.","tags":["algebra","set theory","software defined networking","telecommunication traffic","network updates","continuous network configuration updates","update execution","data-plane operation","independent-update dominant settings","update completion time","update arrival rate","sequential updates","update composition","update algebra","abstract algebra","asymptotic analysis","SDN traffic engineering application","continuous nonblocking composition","Benchmark testing","Mathematical model","Abstract algebra","Pipeline processing","Software","Systematics"],"title":"Update Algebra: Toward Continuous, Non-Blocking Composition of Network Updates in SDN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Geng Li","Yichen Qian","Y.

By analyzing the data analytics trace from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the largest scientific experiments in the world, and systematically examining the design of existing resource management systems for clusters, we show that the multi-domain, geo-distributed, resource-disaggregated nature of this new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources, with the objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of different domains, and that the fundamental challenge for designing such a framework is: how to accurately discover and represent resource availability of a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources across different domains with minimal information exposure from each domain? Existing resource management systems are designed for single-domain clusters and cannot address this challenge. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics. In Unicorn, we encode the resource availability for each domain into resource state abstraction, a variant of the network view abstraction extended to accurately represent the availability of multiple resources with minimal information exposure using a set of linear inequalities. We then design a novel, efficient cross-domain query algorithm and a privacy-preserving resource information integration protocol to discover and integrate the accurate, minimal resource availability information for a set of data analytics jobs across different domains. In addition, Unicorn also contains a global resource orchestrator that computes optimal resource allocation decisions for data analytics jobs. We implement a prototype of Unicorn and present preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy. We also give a full demonstration of the Unicorn system at SuperComputing 2017.","tags":null,"title":"Unicorn: Unified resource orchestration for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiao Xiang","J.

Current approaches heavily rely on the (logically) centralized controller to initiate and orchestrate the network updates, resulting in long latency of update completion. In this paper, we present DDP, a system for fast, distributed network updates while preserving various consistency properties. The key technique in DDP is a novel primitive named datapath operation container (DOC), where each DOC is encoded with an individual operation and its dependency logic. DDP adopts the simple, but powerful DOCs to configure the network, so that network updates can be triggered and executed at the data plane in a distributed and local manner. Novel algorithms are designed to compute and optimize the DOCs for consistent updates. We implement DDP to evaluate its performance in various update scenarios. Experimental results show that DDP significantly improves network update speed by up to 52.1% for the real-time updates initiated by the controller, and further improves the speed by 55.6-61.4% for the updates directly triggered at the data plane, such as failure recovery.","tags":[],"title":"DDP: Distributed Network Updates in SDN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

While there are previous studies addressing the case of non-reactive flows, the prediction for reactive flows, e.g., flows managed by TCP congestion control algorithms, still remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify three challenges in providing throughput prediction for reactive flows: throughput dynamics, heterogeneous reactive control mechanisms, and source-constrained flows. Based on a previous theoretical model, we introduce a novel learning- based prediction system with a key component named fast factor learning (FFL) model.

Each UE requires to decide whether to connect to the BS, or to get associated with one of the D2D relays, a.k.a. cluster heads (CHs). To optimize the downlink system performance, we propose a game-theoretic user association scheme in the UDN with D2D relays, specifically focused on load balancing among the BS and CHs. The dynamic user association is formulated as a hedonic coalition game where we adopt a simplified but efficient measurement of the utility and select the effective game players in a smaller number. In the game,we estimate the number of users associated with each CH at the Nash-stable state which can indicate the overall expected load condition, and an admission control mechanism is finally employed on the basis of these values.

Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes it possible to obtain a global view of the network, introducing the new paradigm of developing adaptive applications with network views. A naive approach of realizing the paradigm, such as distributing the whole network view to applications, is not practical due to scalability and privacy concerns. Existing approaches providing network abstractions are limited to special cases, such as bottlenecks exist only at networks edges, resulting in potentially suboptimal or infeasible decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel, on-demand network abstraction service that provides an abstract network view supporting not only accurate end-to-end QoS metrics, which satisfy the requirements of many peer-to-peer applications, but also multi-flow correlation, which is essential for bandwidth-sensitive applications containing many flows to conduct global network optimization. We prove that our abstract view is equivalent to the original network view, in the sense that applications can make the same optimal decision as with the complete information. Our evaluations demonstrate that the abstraction guarantees feasibility and optimality for network optimizations and protects the network service providers' privacy. Our evaluations also show that the service can be implemented efficiently; for example, for an extreme large network with 30,000 links and abstraction requests containing 3,000 flows, an abstract network view can be computed in less than one second.","tags":[],"title":"NOVA: Towards on-demand equivalent network view abstraction for network optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Gao","Chen Gu","Qiao Xiang","Xin Wang","Y.

However, with the growing network scale and applications' need for routing state at multi-domain level, feeding complete routing states to applications would jeopardize their scalability and network providers' privacy. Thus a good routing state abstraction is needed, which must be on-demand so that different applications can receive customized abstract state suiting their needs. Moreover, it must be minimal and equivalent, i.e., containing all the necessary information for applications to make decisions as the complete state does with no redundancy. Current routing state abstractions are not on-demand, and adopt extreme aggregation approaches (e.g., the big switch) to provide a minimal abstraction with the price of severe information loss. For instance, bottleneck links shared between flows are concealed, leading applications to make sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we design ORSAP, the first on-demand routing state abstraction protocol, through which network applications can describe their demands while Internet service providers can provide the on-demand minimal equivalent routing state accordingly. ORSAP ensures applications' scalability, protects network providers' privacy, and significantly reduces the traffic to disseminate the information. Experiments show that with ORSAP and the abstraction engine we introduced in this paper, one can achieve a state abstraction ratio of up to 60% with an extremely low computation time even with large networks and complex application queries.","tags":[],"title":"ORSAP: Abstracting routing state on demand (Poster)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Gao","Chen Gu","Qiao Xiang","Y.

One promising facility called fast charging reservation(FCR) system was recently proposed. It allows people to reserve fast chargers ahead of time. In this system, fast chargers are the most scarce resource instead of electricity. Thus how to allocate these charging points requires careful designing. A good allocation policy should 1) ensure charging points to be allocated to EV users who really value them, and 2) prevent users' private information, e.g., identity, personal agenda, residing area and etc., from being inferred. A simple combination of classic multi-item auction and user identity anonymization cannot satisfy both criteria simultaneously. To find such an allocation, in this paper we investigate the design of privacy-preserving auctions in FCR systems. Traditional privacy-preserving strategies such as cryptography could incur high computation and communication overhead and hence jeopardize the efficiency of allocation. To this end, we propose Auc2Reserve, a differentially private randomized auction. Auc2Reserve applies an improved approximate sampler and the belief propagation (BP) technique to accelerate the resource allocation and pricing process. As a result, it is much more computationally efficient than generic exponential differentially private mechanisms and other theoretical approximate implementations. Through theoretical analysis, we show that Auc2Reserve is ?-incentive compatible, individual rational and ?-differentially private. And it provides a close-form approximation ratio in social welfare of FCR systems. In addition, we also demonstrate the efficacy of Auc2Reserve in terms of social welfare and privacy leakage via numerical simulation.","tags":["electric vehicles","pricing","resource allocation","smart power grids","transportation","Auc2Reserve","differentially private auction","electric vehicle fast charging reservation","allocation policy","multiitem auction","user identity anonymization","privacy-preserving auctions","FCR systems","cryptography","Auc2Reserve","resource allocation","pricing process","close-form approximation ratio","Resource management","Cost accounting","Pricing","Privacy","Computer science","Electric vehicles","Cryptography","smart grid","electric vehicle","mechanism design","privacy"],"title":"Auc2Reserve: A Differentially Private Auction for Electric Vehicle Fast Charging Reservation (Invited Paper)","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1465750293,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465750293,"objectID":"011247678a2b0890a227dd0dfd148f36","permalink":"/talk/sdn-programming-automation-abstraction-tools-and-applications/","publishdate":"2016-06-13T00:51:33+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/sdn-programming-automation-abstraction-tools-and-applications/","section":"talk","summary":"June 1 to 2, 2016, “Global SDNFV Tech Conference 2016” has been grandly held in Beijing.
