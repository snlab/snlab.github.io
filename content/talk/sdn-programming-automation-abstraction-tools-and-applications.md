# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "June 1 to 2, 2016, “Global SDNFV Tech Conference 2016” has been grandly held in Beijing. Prof. Yang and SNLab members are invited to participate in this conference. Prof. Yang made a speech entitled “*SDN programming automation: abstraction, tools, and implementations*”. In this talk, Prof.Yang explained the goal of SNLab, cache and acceleration automation, and present some prototypes of our projects, which include *Magellan*, automatic generation of multi-level flow tables, *Maple*, using TraceTree to change high level algorithm policies into the low level flow entries, and *FAST*, automatic re-execution function instances to make sure the correctness of user functions."
