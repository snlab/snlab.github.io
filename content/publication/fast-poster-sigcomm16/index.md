# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Handling state dependencies is a major challenge in modern SDN programming, but existing frameworks do not provide sufficient abstractions nor tools to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-level programming abstraction and implement the *Function Automation SysTem (FAST)*. With the two key features, i.e., *automated state dependency tracking* and *efficient re-execution scheduling*, we demonstrate that FAST substantially simplifies state-dependent SDN programming and boosts the performance."
