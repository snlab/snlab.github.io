      <description>SNLab organized the workshop in May 5-6th, 2016. This workshop bring together experts from software-defined networking, wireless/hybrid networks, tactical networks, high-performance computing and related disciplines to investigate both the benefits and the issues when applying SDN to army applications. The emergence of SDN, whose key features include separation between the data-plane and the control-plane of networks, and logically centralized network control, has potential to completely reshape the field of computer networking.</description>

      <description>June 1 to 2, 2016, “Global SDNFV Tech Conference 2016” has been grandly held in Beijing. Prof. Yang and SNLab members are invited to participate in this conference. Prof. Yang made a speech entitled “*SDN programming automation: abstraction, tools, and implementations*”. In this talk, Prof.Yang explained the goal of SNLab, cache and acceleration automation, and present some prototypes of our projects, which include Magellan, automatic generation of multi-level flow tables, Maple, using TraceTree to change high level algorithm policies into the low level flow entries, and FAST, automatic re-execution function instances to make sure the correctness of user functions.</description>
